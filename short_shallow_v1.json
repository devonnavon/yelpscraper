And if you still can't find anything, the bartenders will put something together for you. Do not hesitate to take advantage of their knowledge, as they can provide guidance to get you exactly what you are looking for. On this evening I tried a Butterbean, a Black Mountain Coffee, and a Coconut Daiquiri. All three were solid drinks, expertly crafted, and beautifully presented.Quantity: Depends on the drink, some are just a few sips, others a solid pour.Value: The majority of cocktails ranged from $13 to $20.Ambiance: The Roosevelt Room is located in Downtown Austin. With a bit of separation from the rest of the Austin bar scene, The Roosevelt Room is a more elegant and stylish spot. As you push past the curtains you enter a dimly lit lounge. Black couches populate the right side and a long bar occupies the left. Black and white paintings decorate the walls, and a screen hung down showing episodes of Twin Peaks. Jazz and traditional pop filled the air, and we were informed live jazz takes over on Thursday. It is an intimate setting, one you almost feel like you should be dressed up to visit.Crowd: Even on a Monday night, nearly every seat in the house was full.

This is NOT a real tiki bar. Let me repeat that, this is NOT a real tiki bar. If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point. \u00a0I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche.

I reserved a cabana for Saturday. The Edge people were excellent at staying in contact before Saturday as the weather was very questionable. They called the day before to see if we would prefer a cabana on Sunday due to the questionable weather. We decided to stick with Saturday with fingers crossed. Luckily Mother Nature was in a favour!About the cabanas: They are so gorgeous, classy, and comfy. They were just as nice and even nicer than some cabanas in Vegas. Equipped with high end, oversize patio furniture, flat screen tv, speaker system, tables, and curtains (for privacy if needed). They tap in upbeat lounge music in the cabanas but they will provide an auxiliary cord for you to hook your phone up to listen to your own tunes. About the service: Our server was Julianna. And OH. IM. GEE, she was amazing! I owned a hotel poolside bar in Waikiki for four years. As a business owner, I was EXTREMELY picky about my employees. Based on her attitude, her service, her personality, I would have LOVED to have Julianna as an employee as I KNOW she would have been a great asset to my bar and business. Julianna was so very patient with us 13 girls who every time she turned around, we were asking for something or for her to take a photo of us. And of course, she so obligingly did and she even posed us and took the photo shots from different angles. So not only is she a great server but a fabulous photographer as well! Being a previous bar owner, I know an employee can make or break a business. Julianna MADE The Edge! If and when we return, we will be requesting her! My hairdresser and her husband are staying at the hotel this Memorial weekend. I already texted her to request Julianna as her server! :)About the food and drinks: We ordered food but I chose the \"liquid lunch\" so I'm not sure how the food was but visually, it look very appetizing and plentiful. We ordered bottle service so can't really tell you how well the drinks were. However, drunk me decided to buy 25 shots (24 lemon drops and 1 Patron shot). The bartendar and Julianna handled the big order very well and timely btw.Views: Incredible!I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend The Edge for your poolside destination! I will admit, it was between them or The W Hotel's pool. The W is \"Guest ONLY\" on Saturdays meaning EVERY person at the pool must be a hotel guest. JW Marriott did not have this rule so THEY made the money off of 13 people with only two of us being hotel guests. And based on the photos of The W's pool, deck, and cabanas.....JW Marriott's The Edge BLOWS them away! One last note/tip: Try to get a room with a pool view if you stay here. The pool has the shape of Texas in the middle which makes a great photo opp! *See attached*"}, {"date": "5/19/2019", "rating": 5.0, "content": "Juliana was awesome in our cabana!!

Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process.

It doesn't take much to make us happy, especially when alcohol is involved. The atmosphere was chill and not at all frenzied and hectic like W. 6th, where we'd witness a distraught young woman sit on the ground and start crying about getting kicked out of Greenlight (how do you get kicked out of a place that busy & crowded?!). It was nearly last call, but there were still enough people around for the watching, and the wells drinks were doing their of killing the pain. Life at Dive Bar was good. If I had any complaint, it would be that the pub mix lacked flavor, but when you're getting hammered for cheap, you really don't care about things like that. Highly recommend for anyone looking to get away from the madness of the entertainment district.And I have to give them a round of applause for having the cleanest restroom of any bar in Austin.

A cool space, but I was not into the summer cocktail menu.Quality: Tried a few cocktails at Whisler's, the Whisler's Old Fashioned, Through The Mist, El Santo, and Fire And Ice. Whisler's Old Fashioned was served in a glass flask, I believe to let the flavors sink in. It was solid, but as usual with the drink very sweet. Through The Mist was vodka-based with grapefruit and coconut cream. I did not love the combo, but my girlfriend did. The two other drinks I tried were mezcal-based, El Santo had lime and raspberry, while Fire And Ice came with vermouth and peach. Neither really hit the spot. This was definitely a summer inspired menu, but the light drinks and sweetness were not working for me.Quantity: All the drinks we had were alcohol forward and fair pours.Value: $11 to $14 for Speciality Cocktails.Ambiance: Whisler's is located east of Downtown Austin. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall dive, but it has a very unique feel inside. Antique touches, old paintings, hanging chandelier, and everything unfinished, give it an old, but cool vibe. Expect rusty chairs and tables, and a feeling that everything is dirty, even though nothing is. They also have a patio area, but it was unusable on a hot summer afternoon.Crowd: A small crowd on Sunday afternoon.Service: The bartenders were passing out sample cocktails for guests to try.

The bartender was aloof and I couldn't get over both the size of the drink - Mimosa \u00a03.5 OZ glass - the Madra's 7 oz glass. The \"juice\" for my drink that should be cranberry and oj had absolutely no flavor, so pretty much tasted like water and vodka. I drank a little bit - went back to the bar and stood there for over 5 minutes waiting for someone to see me ( didnt wait longer since I am currently sporting an Airboot for my ankle ) So I grabbed some oranges and made some more juice.

The music was amazing we even ate some of the food and that was delicious, to the point that we ordered another basket, and we danced the night away.

I just LOVE the vibe at The Skylark Lounge! It's the perfect combination of darkness & just very Austin-like. Its a very intimate venue to enjoy awesome live music & there is even a small dance floor if you feel like shaking something ;). -Young & old come to enjoy music FYI(s) & Helpful Info:-Parking: There's a small gravel parking lot at The Skylark but it gets filled very fast. This past Sat. they put a sign near the front of the parking lot once parking was full to notify people that there was additional parking next door at a bodyshop but that lot also got filled fast but FYI you can also park on the street, which isn't to far of a walk to the venue. -There was a $7 cash cover charge on the Saturday we went on 2/15/2019 -There is seating inside w/ tables & a few booths & seating at the bar but it can get filled pretty fast so I recommend you get there early to grab your spot. There's also outside seating w/ lots of tables & an outdoor tv & outdoor lights. -There's a pool table :) -There is a full bar & you can also buy food to munch on while you're enjoying the awesome music. The night we were there you could order food from The Peoples Soul Food & the owner of that company came by every table to give you the menu & take your order. The Soul Fries on the menu for $4 were so delicious!! You could also buy bbq from Sams BBQ outside in the back. For sure whenever you're in the mood to check out some awesome & talented musicians make sure to check out The Skylark Lounges website to see who's scheduled to play. For sure I'll be checking out The Skylark Lounge again in the near future. -Rebecca out"}, {"date": "2/14/2019", "rating": 5.0, "content": "The Skylark Lounge is the Austin I've been looking for! Take a seat, I have so much to say.Before moving here recently, I had a perception of Austin, one which I had yet to experience--until now. While the husband and Daughter #4 were off to the Fleetwood Mac concert at Frank Erwin Center, Daughter #2 and I also planned a night of good music, blues or jazz, but where? I didn't want to pay $20 (Note: husband paid shockingly way more than that for their concert tickets.) for a band I'd never heard of. And I didn't want to meander down 6th with the youngins. So Daughter #2 and I put our best research skills to work. We found a bunch of places with live music (duh, it's Austin), looked at online photos to find the right vibe, compared cover charges and listened to clips from featured acts. Skylark Lounge came out on top.Parking is very limited. Somehow we managed a spot right in front (I think because it was tight, few ventured to try it. Thanks, Mom, for teaching me how to parallel park all those years ago!) Frankly, I'm not sure where people park if not in the lot. From the outside, it looked like a long, wooden shack. No...a roadhouse...yes, it looked like the quintessential roadhouse. The cover charge was $7 (higher than the $5 listed online.) Very dark, low ceilings, limited seating. To the left as you walk in, it is long and narrow with three main sections: a bar with some seats on one wall, a row of tables (low and high tables) in the middle and booths along the other wall. Every seat was taken when we arrived and the aisle between the bar and the tables was also jam-packed. The stage is at the far end and next to it is a doorway leading to an outdoor patio. I believe there is a room to the right of the entrance with a pool table. We managed to get our drinks, then I moved to stand in the aisle between the booths and the tables, where there were fewer people. Within 15 minutes, a couple at one of the high tables was leaving, so we were able to grab their seats.Here's something I loved: besides the booths, it seemed that those sitting together at the tables were strangers. I watched as three 20-somethings sat at a table with two 60-somethings and, soon, all were chatting and laughing as if they'd know each other for years. Our seatmates weren't quite as chatty, but nice just the same. Performing when we arrived was Oscar Ornelas. OMG. The guy was FANTASTIC! I simply cannot say enough about Oscar and his band. The talent, the energy. At one point, Oscar was playing the piano with one hand, playing the saxophone with the other hand and singing in between blows. It was simply spectacular.There was a very long intermission as the second act--Birdlegg and the Tight Fit Blues Band--were waiting on a band member. I ventured outside to the patio to find Birdlegg himself. Such a character (and a flirt!) Had a lot of fun hearing his stories and he even wrapped his coat around me when I got chilled. When Birdlegg took the stage, he became the consummate professional. Singing, playing the harmonica, and dancing in a manner that defied his 71 years. He owned the stage and the crowd loved him.We didn't order any food, but my Moscow Mules were quite tasty. The pour became a little weaker as the night went on (sorry, guy, I wasn't too drunk to notice) but it was remedied upon request. Not only would I go back to Skylark Lounge for sure, I cannot wait to go back!"}, {"date": "2/14/2019", "rating": 4.0, "content": "What a fantastic hot spot. Hidden away and off the main road, Skylark is the quintessential Austin music venue you hear about. I brought my mom here on a Saturday for blues/jazz and she was blown away. The live music was fantastic and entertaining. $7 cover for a Saturday night, cash only. There is one main room, with the stage in the back corner. Luckily the music can be heard throughout, however, seating is limited, and standing by the bar does make it challenging to see the band. We were able to snag a seat from a couple leaving after about 15 minutes of arriving. Out back is a garden/patio with a fire pit and seating. Many use for smoking. My mom had an opportunity to meet the extremely charismatic harmonica player who was going on at 10pm. He was extremely warm and friendly. Made watching him perform on stage so much cooler! Such a talented gem who we would definitely return to see. Overall, this is the place you go for a lively, but chill night. Great mixed aged crowd with some scattered regulars. Recommend to get there earlier (before 8:30pm) to snag a seat, although if you come later, seating is possible, but be prepared to potentially stand until someone leaves. Only complaint was that the pour on some Moscow mules was weak. We addressed this with the bartender and he returned to his original pour. Appreciated his willingness to listen and adjust.

The selection of beers is as varied and eclectic as the clientele here, and are the two main reasons I enjoy this place so much. It's also pup and kiddo friendly. So, win, win for my motley crew when we need a beer at the end of a long week. There is a logistical funk when it comes to ordering a beer. Thank goodness they opened up another outdoor bar in the said new seating area, because the bar inside starts to accrue a bottleneck, and fast. Don't get me wrong, the interior is really cool with ye olde pub feels and a dark wood bar to help you feel as if you're in a true UK pub.

I hate the fact that the \"big boys\" brewers are slowly slipping in so I suspect that in time there will be lots more taps. \u00a0 \u00a0We even chatted it up with a few of the regulars who lamented about the same stuff. \u00a0On our last visit we find out that our favorite bartender Sluggo isn't there so now we don't feel like this is DH anymore. \u00a0It's difficult to find a bar that you like and it's even more difficult to make that bar your weekly jaunt because several things must be aligned: kick any local breweries that sold out to the big boys to the curb (check; until recently); one 19\" TV on, at most, in a corner and on the news (in case North Korea sends a missile, so we know), No Coors/bud/bud-light/PBR, etc. That attracts a different crowd. Place needs to have character, wall art, or something that makes it stand out from the herd from all the other drinking holes in this town, for some reason the new 'look' is barren.Finally the man (or woman) behind the bar is a special breed of person that knows their $hiT. \u00a0We'd walk in and Sluggo told us about new beers and had a taster in mind for something he thought one of us would like (he was usually right). \u00a0For many years, many Thursdays, we felt like this was our \"Cheers\" bar. \u00a0This is the place we took out of town company to, met friends at, and we grew to love the place as the bar that outlasted all of the novelty bars over the years. We're not sure anymore and don't like the changes creeping in so we're going to take some time off for awhile and see what happens. \u00a0It's not like there isn't any other place in Austin that doesn't serve good craft beer, right? \u00a0Good luck DH, I hope change is good and you achieve what you're after."}, {"date": "2/25/2018", "rating": 4.0, "content": "great selection of brews. nice place to take my friends when they come to visit"}]}}, {"Violet Crown Social Club": {"name": "Violet Crown Social Club", "price": "$", "ratings": {"2016": [4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5], "2017": [4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5], "2018": [4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5], "2019": [4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0], "2015": [4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0]}, "hours": [{"Mon": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}, {"Tue": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}, {"Wed": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}, {"Thu": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}, {"Fri": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}, {"Sat": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}, {"Sun": "5:00 pm - 2:00 am"}], "info": {"Takes Reservations": "No", "Accepts Credit Cards": "Yes", "Accepts Apple Pay": "No", "Parking": "Street, Private Lot", "Bike Parking": "Yes", "Good for Groups": "Yes", "Ambience": "Divey, Casual, Classy", "Noise Level": "Average", "Music": "Juke Box", "Alcohol": "Full Bar", "Good For Happy Hour": "Yes", "Best Nights": "Thu, Fri, Sat", "Outdoor Seating": "Yes", "Wi-Fi": "Free", "Has TV": "Yes", "Has Pool Table": "No"}, "reviews": [{"date": "8/12/2019\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "rating": 5.0, "content": "Great happy hour and always cheap drinks other wise.

He tells us that tips are the only money he makes there, and if we don't tip, we don't sing. He then assured us we will go on next, this time, but in the future we have to pay per song if we don't wanna be skipped. Three songs later and of course, no mention of our names.

Indulgent and enjoyable with allthe chocolate goodness melding quite well together.All in all food wise, loved the burrata, enjoyed the dessert, but I'd probably skip having a full meal here pre-show in the future.Now seeing a show here? It's ideal. Amazing sound and there's no bad seat in the house but seeing an artist you like in the front seats is UNREAL! It's such an intimate venue so I just fell in love with it.

There, he had seen cow shit bingo, but he suggested using chickens instead. Their response was: \"It's never gonna last.\" Today, the 25-year tradition would suggest otherwise.Chicken Shit Bingo is part of the nostalgia and history of the bar. The bar now serves a large assortment of wines and champagnes, plus 80 different types of beer other than drafts. And in keeping with the times, the saloon now accepts credit cards--not just cash.The best part of the game is the excitement of the crowd, especially the children: \"Chicken Shit Bingo is about the camaraderie and the fun.Between 4 pm and 8 pm, locals gather for a unique version of bingo involving chickens, chicken feed, and what chickens do after they eat. All ages are welcome to both watch and participate in this event, which you have to see to believe. For a donation of $2.00, participants purchase a ticket in line: children 13 and younger go first, and adults aged 92 and older go second.Once all the tickets are gone, the first of four rounds begins. Each ticket corresponds to a number on the table, and if the chicken eliminates on your ticket's number, you win a cash prize. The Chicken Shit Official tells the band the winning number, and they, in turn, announce it on stage. Winners have their photos taken, and the next round begins!A valid I.D. is required to purchase alcohol, and you must be 21+ to drink. Sodas and other non-alcoholic beverages are also available. To really experience the dive bar like a local, pull up a bar stool and enjoy an ice-cold Lone Star beer while you watch or play along!"}, {"date": "4/9/2019", "rating": 4.0, "content": "Sunday funday for the chicken sh** bingo is where it's at!!

Of course, this is because women take longer in the bathroom. There is no reason to make women wait twenty minutes in front of a blaring speaker to pee while men can just walk straight in.On this day, the women's line had about ten people in it, so I stood in the men's line, which no one was in. A drunk man came up and stood in front of me and wouldn't move. He dramatically pointed out that it's the MEN'S room, to which I replied that this is completely arbitrary and there's no reason to demarcate them that way if only one person can use it at a time. I really needed to go. He eventually relented, but kept banging on the door while I was in there. It was unpleasant and so unnecessary. At least one other man gave me shit about it also.This issue could easily be alleviated by not gendering the bathrooms, which would also make the space more welcoming to trans and non-binary people. There is absolutely no reason to assign a gender to these single-stall bathrooms, and thus there is no reason for the saloon to not be accommodating to women and other people who would be helped by simply removing the gender signs from the bathroom doors. One star for the lack of reply, which indicates that this business doesn't care about addressing the needs of its patrons."}, {"date": "3/10/2019", "rating": 5.0, "content": "Had a great time at the Little Longhorn Saloon! \u00a0Enjoyed 'chicken shit bingo' on a Sunday afternoon, and stayed a little longer to listen to the superb live band. \u00a0Good beers, good atmosphere and a friendly vibe."}, {"date": "2/23/2019", "rating": 5.0, "content": "Great prices (even better during happy hour), great beer selection and some of the coolest bartenders around.

There's a street-side front door but regulars often come in the back because, a.) it opens directly to the restrooms, and, b.) the front door is literally next to the band. If they're in session and you walk in crooked (get that Uber boy) you will bump into the guitarist.For a tiny place the seating has been optimized: a railing with ledge along one wall, a bar, and tables too. You can get in here. When you do get in this is what you find.Friendly people of all different types: blue collar, white collar and no collar. Diversity in age and ethnicity. Old and young alike. Getting the picture? Everyone is friendly here. And most folks have enough sense to bus their own tables when leaving - there's a big old blue recycling bin easily accessible at the end of the bar - because mist people here are not so stuck up they need to underline that by leaving their detritus on a table and make the happy - and harried - bartender run around and pick up after others!Remember your server.You get good music - maybe blues, maybe Americana, maybe something else - by a variety of artists played with enthusiasm and lots of talking back and forth with the crowd. And you get those restrooms. By the way, while I don't know about the women's the men's room is clean and better lit than the bar!Drinks are reasonable, the bartenders friendly and it's just hard not to have a good time here.Why only four stars?

It has a great divey feel to it, wide-open spaces, a pool table, televisions, \u00a0an outside beer garden and a wonderful variety of canned and bottled beer. It also does not have your typical red or white wine, you actually get a few choices.Its also kid and pet friendly too and it's a really a wonderful place for the whole family. They also have live music from Thursday to Sunday and from what I understand WC Clarke will be playing there soon. Look for Allyson, she is as smart as she is cute. She made me feel so welcome and is appreciative when people come in. I'm looking forward to spending a lot more time and winding down at the BARn.P.S.

So if you want to get a seat to watch a show, I have no idea what time you may need to arrive?I'd say go prepared to stand for the evening.

Not sure if another band is playing, but also not sure whether I want to hear them or not based on that last performance. The atmosphere here is dark and depressing, but with a disco ball, bc everybody knows a disco ball means you're ready to PAR-TAY like its 1899. My guess is I'd have a much better time chilling with that girl who stopped me in the street earlier and asked if she could pray for me. We did. It would be cool if she were my guardian angel, but I doubt it. Her name was Brie. Like the cheese. But she didn't have any on her. She was nice and we took a cute, awkward selfie in the street together.Anyway, I'm only staying here longer because I'm pretty sure I won't get my 10 bucks back from the guy up front if I inform him that I wouldn't have paid to come here if I knew the music was just irredeemably godawful. Maybe watching some of these old, drunk people will be worth it. Nah, doubtful. First live music experience in Austin is much like the atmosphere as described above. I'm just a lone, weird disco ball in a dark, lonely world of ancient pseudo-debauchery, where its anybody's guess which will die next: me from boredom and my stubbornness due a sunk cost fallacy vs. One of the old people falling off a barstool vs each and every one of all of our dreams we've ever had...Taking bets now...just hoping to make back 5 of my dollars and then call it a wash.

Yes, we had been drinking but not nearly enough to be cut off. Never in my life have I been cut off from drinking at a bar, ESPECIALLY with my father. It was really weird so we decided to leave.
