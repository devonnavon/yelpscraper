          "content": "Had cocktails at The Roosevelt Room on Monday night. Wonderful environment to enjoy some well crafted and delicious drinks.Quality: The Roosevelt Room is the spot for cocktails in Austin. With a menu listing nearly 75 options, some house creations, others classic cocktails, there is something for everyone. And if you still can't find anything, the bartenders will put something together for you. Do not hesitate to take advantage of their knowledge, as they can provide guidance to get you exactly what you are looking for. On this evening I tried a Butterbean, a Black Mountain Coffee, and a Coconut Daiquiri. All three were solid drinks, expertly crafted, and beautifully presented.Quantity: Depends on the drink, some are just a few sips, others a solid pour.Value: The majority of cocktails ranged from $13 to $20.Ambiance: The Roosevelt Room is located in Downtown Austin. With a bit of separation from the rest of the Austin bar scene, The Roosevelt Room is a more elegant and stylish spot. As you push past the curtains you enter a dimly lit lounge. Black couches populate the right side and a long bar occupies the left. Black and white paintings decorate the walls, and a screen hung down showing episodes of Twin Peaks. Jazz and traditional pop filled the air, and we were informed live jazz takes over on Thursday. It is an intimate setting, one you almost feel like you should be dressed up to visit.Crowd: Even on a Monday night, nearly every seat in the house was full. Expect to see lots of couples on dates.Service: Bartenders that don't mess around when it comes to quality drinks.Parking: Limited street parking and nearby parking garages."

The vibe/ inside decor is so so cool. There are pictures of Teddy and Eleanor on the walls and old books everywhere which is super fun. The menu is a little overwhelming at first but the waiters are super helpful and walk you through everything. We tried 1 alcoholic and 1 non-alcoholic and they were both amazing! Super nice spot the chill before going out or going to dinner."

The menus deep, varied, and delicious. There's something for everyone here. Within each drink category it starts mellow and gets progressively boozy. For me the Volstead (1933-1950's) was the sweet spot. The Millionaire was incredible! Went back for the Tiki (1950-1970's) Jungle Bird, you've never had anything like this. Modern Classics (2000s - present) Naked and Famous should be famous. And the Oaxaca Old Fashion is a mole twist on the tried and true old fashioned. Make plans, make a reservation and go. It's worth. Did I mention they play classic movies too! Yes please."

If you can, sit at the bar or in view. The best show in the house is watching a bartender craft these special drinks. It really is awe inspiring. But don't be in a hurry. These take some time and the place is packed. Be patient and order the next round a little early."

The atmosphere was speakeasy chic, but casual and the bartenders were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The selections were expansive. They had a board of cocktails that walk you through eras and have so many things that you've never had. I asked Eric (on of the folks on staff)  to make something he thought was great and he asked some insightful questions and delivered a VERY good cocktail. I'd say it's a good place for a date and a good places to be with good friends, especially if you are tired of other Austin watering holes. The atmosphere, service, and goods are....well good. I'll be back every time in in town and their open."

Happy Hour until 7pm for $7 specials and half off bubbles on Sundays. Can get expensive if you want to go with big liquors but a classic cocktail is about $14 which is reasonable considering these bartenders are top of the line and know their stuff. Had an old fashioned and really just a very good rendition  easy to just sit here and sip for a few hours with not too much hassle. Can get loud and have one projector, but if you go earlier in day the bar will be all yours. I will be back late night and test out some of the classics for sure."

So much more to write about this restaurant and the menu, but it's something you need to come and see for yourself. Come thirsty and hungry, because it's definitely worth the visit!"

We actually hit up 5 other bars the same night and never was once asked to be quiet. Joy actually humiliated our server and was extremely unprofessional. Joy came up to us while our server was at our table and asked us to be quiet. She then proceeded to discipline our server in front of us, making it uncomfortable for her and us. Joy basically was pissed because Hirrah our server didn't tell us to be quiet and she had to do it...one we weren't loud until she said something and continued to walk by our table and glare at us. She walked by 4 times within a 15 minute timeframe glaring. What kind of manager does that? If I were the owner I would re-evaluate who is managing the place cause you're gonna lose good people like Hirrah. Other than that, the food was delicious, drinks were also great. Being a visitor of Austin, I probably would not suggest coming here because of Joy. Her unprofessionalism was uncalled for."

I arrived for my first visit at the Roosevelt Room.I opened the heavy door to a dark area a small creature (I'm guessing some sort of host) who just looked at me.  I explained I was there to meet someone (I knew my colleague was already there so I walked past them and the heavy curtain) and the small creature said \"do you know they are HERE?\" I wasn't sure if they were implying like \"here\" as in place, space, or time, but I just said \"yes\" and moved on.  I had a feeling I was not the preferred demographic of the Roosevelt Room.I found my friend (who was from San Antonio) and apologized for being late because a 10 minute drive was 30 minutes and Austin is horrible.  She apologized because she said that she  realized that the Roosevelt Room waitstaff was very important and probably wouldn't be very attentive.  I told her that I was used to that because this is Austin and when you go out in Austin it is really like you are working for the waitstaff not like they are serving you.  I think it is part of the \"experience\".The Roosevelt Room is very dark and has an atmosphere going on.  It's great.  But if you are of the demographic that might need readers - you probably won't be able to see the menu.  So just ask the waiter (when they have time to show up) what drink they recommend and then they will help you out.  The drinks are really good and quite pretty.  And expensive.  Overall we had a good time at the Roosevelt Room.  Once our waiter realized we were spending a lot (expense account) he had more time for us.  Doubtful I will return.  We did eat some cheese board type food.  It was somewhat unremarkable.  We had to wait a while for everything (they kitchen was backed up... it was cheese!) They have giant ice cubes if you are into that."

I arrived for my first visit at the Roosevelt Room.I opened the heavy door to a dark area a small creature (I'm guessing some sort of host) who just looked at me.  I explained I was there to meet someone (I knew my colleague was already there so I walked past them and the heavy curtain) and the small creature said \"do you know they are HERE?\" I wasn't sure if they were implying like \"here\" as in place, space, or time, but I just said \"yes\" and moved on.  I had a feeling I was not the preferred demographic of the Roosevelt Room.I found my friend (who was from San Antonio) and apologized for being late because a 10 minute drive was 30 minutes and Austin is horrible.  She apologized because she said that she  realized that the Roosevelt Room waitstaff was very important and probably wouldn't be very attentive.  I told her that I was used to that because this is Austin and when you go out in Austin it is really like you are working for the waitstaff not like they are serving you.  I think it is part of the \"experience\".The Roosevelt Room is very dark and has an atmosphere going on.  It's great.  But if you are of the demographic that might need readers - you probably won't be able to see the menu.  So just ask the waiter (when they have time to show up) what drink they recommend and then they will help you out.  The drinks are really good and quite pretty.  And expensive.  Overall we had a good time at the Roosevelt Room.  Once our waiter realized we were spending a lot (expense account) he had more time for us.  Doubtful I will return.  We did eat some cheese board type food.  It was somewhat unremarkable.  We had to wait a while for everything (they kitchen was backed up... it was cheese!) They have giant ice cubes if you are into that."

Happy Hour until 7pm for $7 specials and half off bubbles on Sundays. Can get expensive if you want to go with big liquors but a classic cocktail is about $14 which is reasonable considering these bartenders are top of the line and know their stuff. Had an old fashioned and really just a very good rendition  easy to just sit here and sip for a few hours with not too much hassle. Can get loud and have one projector, but if you go earlier in day the bar will be all yours. I will be back late night and test out some of the classics for sure."

They had a board of cocktails that walk you through eras and have so many things that you've never had. I asked Eric (on of the folks on staff)  to make something he thought was great and he asked some insightful questions and delivered a VERY good cocktail. I'd say it's a good place for a date and a good places to be with good friends, especially if you are tired of other Austin watering holes. The atmosphere, service, and goods are....well good.

With a bit of separation from the rest of the Austin bar scene, The Roosevelt Room is a more elegant and stylish spot. As you push past the curtains you enter a dimly lit lounge. Black couches populate the right side and a long bar occupies the left. Black and white paintings decorate the walls, and a screen hung down showing episodes of Twin Peaks. Jazz and traditional pop filled the air, and we were informed live jazz takes over on Thursday. It is an intimate setting, one you almost feel like you should be dressed up to visit.Crowd: Even on a Monday night, nearly every seat in the house was full. Expect to see lots of couples on dates.Service: Bartenders that don't mess around when it comes to quality drinks.Parking: Limited street parking and nearby parking garages."

We actually hit up 5 other bars the same night and never was once asked to be quiet. Joy actually humiliated our server and was extremely unprofessional. Joy came up to us while our server was at our table and asked us to be quiet. She then proceeded to discipline our server in front of us, making it uncomfortable for her and us. Joy basically was pissed because Hirrah our server didn't tell us to be quiet and she had to do it...one we weren't loud until she said something and continued to walk by our table and glare at us. She walked by 4 times within a 15 minute timeframe glaring. What kind of manager does that? If I were the owner I would re-evaluate who is managing the place cause you're gonna lose good people like Hirrah. Other than that, the food was delicious, drinks were also great. Being a visitor of Austin, I probably would not suggest coming here because of Joy. Her unprofessionalism was uncalled for."

I arrived for my first visit at the Roosevelt Room.I opened the heavy door to a dark area a small creature (I'm guessing some sort of host) who just looked at me.  I explained I was there to meet someone (I knew my colleague was already there so I walked past them and the heavy curtain) and the small creature said \"do you know they are HERE?\" I wasn't sure if they were implying like \"here\" as in place, space, or time, but I just said \"yes\" and moved on.  I had a feeling I was not the preferred demographic of the Roosevelt Room.I found my friend (who was from San Antonio) and apologized for being late because a 10 minute drive was 30 minutes and Austin is horrible.  She apologized because she said that she  realized that the Roosevelt Room waitstaff was very important and probably wouldn't be very attentive.  I told her that I was used to that because this is Austin and when you go out in Austin it is really like you are working for the waitstaff not like they are serving you.  I think it is part of the \"experience\".The Roosevelt Room is very dark and has an atmosphere going on.  It's great.  But if you are of the demographic that might need readers - you probably won't be able to see the menu.  So just ask the waiter (when they have time to show up) what drink they recommend and then they will help you out.  The drinks are really good and quite pretty.  And expensive.  Overall we had a good time at the Roosevelt Room.  Once our waiter realized we were spending a lot (expense account) he had more time for us.  Doubtful I will return.  We did eat some cheese board type food.  It was somewhat unremarkable.  We had to wait a while for everything (they kitchen was backed up... it was cheese!) They have giant ice cubes if you are into that."

I arrived for my first visit at the Roosevelt Room.I opened the heavy door to a dark area a small creature (I'm guessing some sort of host) who just looked at me.  I explained I was there to meet someone (I knew my colleague was already there so I walked past them and the heavy curtain) and the small creature said \"do you know they are HERE?\" I wasn't sure if they were implying like \"here\" as in place, space, or time, but I just said \"yes\" and moved on.  I had a feeling I was not the preferred demographic of the Roosevelt Room.I found my friend (who was from San Antonio) and apologized for being late because a 10 minute drive was 30 minutes and Austin is horrible.  She apologized because she said that she  realized that the Roosevelt Room waitstaff was very important and probably wouldn't be very attentive.  I told her that I was used to that because this is Austin and when you go out in Austin it is really like you are working for the waitstaff not like they are serving you.  I think it is part of the \"experience\".The Roosevelt Room is very dark and has an atmosphere going on.  It's great.  But if you are of the demographic that might need readers - you probably won't be able to see the menu.  So just ask the waiter (when they have time to show up) what drink they recommend and then they will help you out.  The drinks are really good and quite pretty.  And expensive.  Overall we had a good time at the Roosevelt Room.  Once our waiter realized we were spending a lot (expense account) he had more time for us.  Doubtful I will return.  We did eat some cheese board type food.  It was somewhat unremarkable.  We had to wait a while for everything (they kitchen was backed up... it was cheese!) They have giant ice cubes if you are into that."

This is a good place to network and connect with business partners and colleagues as well as bring a hot date to at the same time. Every penny is well worth it.

I sure haven't until Joy, who is apparently the manager of the restaurant did. Mind you, the restaurant was loud and packed full of people and by no means were we being louder than our usual. We actually hit up 5 other bars the same night and never was once asked to be quiet. Joy actually humiliated our server and was extremely unprofessional. Joy came up to us while our server was at our table and asked us to be quiet. She then proceeded to discipline our server in front of us, making it uncomfortable for her and us. Joy basically was pissed because Hirrah our server didn't tell us to be quiet and she had to do it...one we weren't loud until she said something and continued to walk by our table and glare at us. She walked by 4 times within a 15 minute timeframe glaring. What kind of manager does that? If I were the owner I would re-evaluate who is managing the place cause you're gonna lose good people like Hirrah. Other than that, the food was delicious, drinks were also great. Being a visitor of Austin, I probably would not suggest coming here because of Joy. Her unprofessionalism was uncalled for."

Wonderful environment to enjoy some well crafted and delicious drinks.Quality: The Roosevelt Room is the spot for cocktails in Austin. With a menu listing nearly 75 options, some house creations, others classic cocktails, there is something for everyone. And if you still can't find anything, the bartenders will put something together for you. Do not hesitate to take advantage of their knowledge, as they can provide guidance to get you exactly what you are looking for. On this evening I tried a Butterbean, a Black Mountain Coffee, and a Coconut Daiquiri. All three were solid drinks, expertly crafted, and beautifully presented.Quantity: Depends on the drink, some are just a few sips, others a solid pour.Value: The majority of cocktails ranged from $13 to $20.Ambiance: The Roosevelt Room is located in Downtown Austin. With a bit of separation from the rest of the Austin bar scene, The Roosevelt Room is a more elegant and stylish spot. As you push past the curtains you enter a dimly lit lounge. Black couches populate the right side and a long bar occupies the left. Black and white paintings decorate the walls, and a screen hung down showing episodes of Twin Peaks. Jazz and traditional pop filled the air, and we were informed live jazz takes over on Thursday. It is an intimate setting, one you almost feel like you should be dressed up to visit.Crowd: Even on a Monday night, nearly every seat in the house was full. Expect to see lots of couples on dates.Service: Bartenders that don't mess around when it comes to quality drinks.Parking: Limited street parking and nearby parking garages."

The vibe/ inside decor is so so cool. There are pictures of Teddy and Eleanor on the walls and old books everywhere which is super fun. The menu is a little overwhelming at first but the waiters are super helpful and walk you through everything. We tried 1 alcoholic and 1 non-alcoholic and they were both amazing!

For me the Volstead (1933-1950's) was the sweet spot. The Millionaire was incredible! Went back for the Tiki (1950-1970's) Jungle Bird, you've never had anything like this. Modern Classics (2000s - present) Naked and Famous should be famous. And the Oaxaca Old Fashion is a mole twist on the tried and true old fashioned. Make plans, make a reservation and go. It's worth. Did I mention they play classic movies too! Yes please."

I asked Eric (on of the folks on staff)  to make something he thought was great and he asked some insightful questions and delivered a VERY good cocktail. I'd say it's a good place for a date and a good places to be with good friends, especially if you are tired of other Austin watering holes. The atmosphere, service, and goods are....well good.

          "content": "We were in Austin from Dallas for a Girls Weekend. I reserved a cabana for Saturday. The Edge people were excellent at staying in contact before Saturday as the weather was very questionable. They called the day before to see if we would prefer a cabana on Sunday due to the questionable weather. We decided to stick with Saturday with fingers crossed. Luckily Mother Nature was in a favour!About the cabanas: They are so gorgeous, classy, and comfy. They were just as nice and even nicer than some cabanas in Vegas. Equipped with high end, oversize patio furniture, flat screen tv, speaker system, tables, and curtains (for privacy if needed). They tap in upbeat lounge music in the cabanas but they will provide an auxiliary cord for you to hook your phone up to listen to your own tunes. About the service: Our server was Julianna. And OH. IM. GEE, she was amazing! I owned a hotel poolside bar in Waikiki for four years. As a business owner, I was EXTREMELY picky about my employees. Based on her attitude, her service, her personality, I would have LOVED to have Julianna as an employee as I KNOW she would have been a great asset to my bar and business. Julianna was so very patient with us 13 girls who every time she turned around, we were asking for something or for her to take a photo of us. And of course, she so obligingly did and she even posed us and took the photo shots from different angles. So not only is she a great server but a fabulous photographer as well! Being a previous bar owner, I know an employee can make or break a business. Julianna MADE The Edge! If and when we return, we will be requesting her! My hairdresser and her husband are staying at the hotel this Memorial weekend. I already texted her to request Julianna as her server! :)About the food and drinks: We ordered food but I chose the \"liquid lunch\" so I'm not sure how the food was but visually, it look very appetizing and plentiful. We ordered bottle service so can't really tell you how well the drinks were. However, drunk me decided to buy 25 shots (24 lemon drops and 1 Patron shot). The bartendar and Julianna handled the big order very well and timely btw.Views: Incredible!I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend The Edge for your poolside destination! I will admit, it was between them or The W Hotel's pool. The W is \"Guest ONLY\" on Saturdays meaning EVERY person at the pool must be a hotel guest. JW Marriott did not have this rule so THEY made the money off of 13 people with only two of us being hotel guests. And based on the photos of The W's pool, deck, and cabanas.....JW Marriott's The Edge BLOWS them away! One last note/tip: Try to get a room with a pool view if you stay here. The pool has the shape of Texas in the middle which makes a great photo opp! *See attached*"

They tap in upbeat lounge music in the cabanas but they will provide an auxiliary cord for you to hook your phone up to listen to your own tunes. About the service: Our server was Julianna. And OH. IM. GEE, she was amazing! I owned a hotel poolside bar in Waikiki for four years. As a business owner, I was EXTREMELY picky about my employees. Based on her attitude, her service, her personality, I would have LOVED to have Julianna as an employee as I KNOW she would have been a great asset to my bar and business. Julianna was so very patient with us 13 girls who every time she turned around, we were asking for something or for her to take a photo of us.

I will admit, it was between them or The W Hotel's pool. The W is \"Guest ONLY\" on Saturdays meaning EVERY person at the pool must be a hotel guest. JW Marriott did not have this rule so THEY made the money off of 13 people with only two of us being hotel guests. And based on the photos of The W's pool, deck, and cabanas.....JW Marriott's The Edge BLOWS them away! One last note/tip: Try to get a room with a pool view if you stay here. The pool has the shape of Texas in the middle which makes a great photo opp! *See attached*"

They tap in upbeat lounge music in the cabanas but they will provide an auxiliary cord for you to hook your phone up to listen to your own tunes. About the service: Our server was Julianna. And OH. IM. GEE, she was amazing! I owned a hotel poolside bar in Waikiki for four years. As a business owner, I was EXTREMELY picky about my employees. Based on her attitude, her service, her personality, I would have LOVED to have Julianna as an employee as I KNOW she would have been a great asset to my bar and business. Julianna was so very patient with us 13 girls who every time she turned around, we were asking for something or for her to take a photo of us.

I will admit, it was between them or The W Hotel's pool. The W is \"Guest ONLY\" on Saturdays meaning EVERY person at the pool must be a hotel guest. JW Marriott did not have this rule so THEY made the money off of 13 people with only two of us being hotel guests. And based on the photos of The W's pool, deck, and cabanas.....JW Marriott's The Edge BLOWS them away! One last note/tip: Try to get a room with a pool view if you stay here. The pool has the shape of Texas in the middle which makes a great photo opp! *See attached*"

Based on her attitude, her service, her personality, I would have LOVED to have Julianna as an employee as I KNOW she would have been a great asset to my bar and business. Julianna was so very patient with us 13 girls who every time she turned around, we were asking for something or for her to take a photo of us.

I will admit, it was between them or The W Hotel's pool. The W is \"Guest ONLY\" on Saturdays meaning EVERY person at the pool must be a hotel guest. JW Marriott did not have this rule so THEY made the money off of 13 people with only two of us being hotel guests. And based on the photos of The W's pool, deck, and cabanas.....JW Marriott's The Edge BLOWS them away! One last note/tip: Try to get a room with a pool view if you stay here. The pool has the shape of Texas in the middle which makes a great photo opp! *See attached*"

I'm sure if you like that kind of scene, it would be really fun, but we were looking for something a little more relaxed and casual. The entrance hidden behind the bookcase is cute, but it doesn't really feel like a true speakeasy. Someone is sitting outside the hostel checking IDs, and there's an obvious handle on the door, as well as a constant stream of people going in and out. The music was very loud and it was almost too crowded to move.The atmosphere inside looked like it would have been very inviting on a quieter night, with big leather booths along the back wall, and nice older style drinks. However, it was so hectic inside that we waited for about ten minutes before giving up without ordering anything."

The ambiance is dark and seedy which I dig, BUT I will say the drinks were poorly executed and the bartender had to look up he ingredients for every drink she made right in front of me, she may have been new but I could definitely tell she didn't know how to make them as they weren't great and she was kinda gruff. I think if I had a better bartender I would have given this place another star. Hope y'all have a better experience than me but definitely worth at least one visit."

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it.

The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it. So glad this is the bar we decided to end our trip on. It really made our experience fun and different!"

The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

She didn't see it and took a tumble. Our fault, no big deal, so I went to the bar to get a glass of water. I stood in line patiently for 10 minutes. The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to.

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it.

The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

This isn't the Austin I knew and grew up in.  I have been to the fire house lounge before to enjoy a few live bands.  I don't think I will be back."

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it. So glad this is the bar we decided to end our trip on. It really made our experience fun and different!"

She didn't see it and took a tumble. Our fault, no big deal, so I went to the bar to get a glass of water. I stood in line patiently for 10 minutes. The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

She didn't see it and took a tumble. Our fault, no big deal, so I went to the bar to get a glass of water. I stood in line patiently for 10 minutes. The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

It gets overly crowded and noisy and the \"speakeasy\" atmosphere gets lost in it.That being said it is a fun time and every time we have guests from out of town this place is in the back of mind to take them to."

The entrance hidden behind the bookcase is cute, but it doesn't really feel like a true speakeasy. Someone is sitting outside the hostel checking IDs, and there's an obvious handle on the door, as well as a constant stream of people going in and out.

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it.

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it.

The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it.

The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

A lot of the time you go to these \"exclusive, hiding, or speakeasy\" type bars and they want to put crazy prices on their drinks because of it. There were to young men behind they are, they were super friendly, really speedy, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. We ended up squeezing 2 high top tables together and our group of 9 girls really had a great time here! We took a group picture on the stage and no one made a fuss about it. So glad this is the bar we decided to end our trip on. It really made our experience fun and different!"

The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

She didn't see it and took a tumble. Our fault, no big deal, so I went to the bar to get a glass of water. I stood in line patiently for 10 minutes. The drinks here take a long time to make, I get that. Then I was at the bar and noticed the barback wasn't busy and I tried to get his attention - obviously anyone can get me a glass of water. What was the response? The bar tender told me not to talk to him. Then he says \"do you want his number or something? Hey what's your number this guy wants your number?\" He also added some homophobic slurs that I won't repeat. What???? That's the most insane response ever. Tossing aside how homophobic that is, how is that the response there? That's the most absurd thing anyone has ever said to me. I told them they're out of water and that's what I was asking for. Begrudgingly the bar back gets me a glass of iceless water. Not the hardest thing in the world, but he decided I needed to be slurred in the process. The guy who decided to say I needed to get someone's number instead of a glass of water was wearing a red hat, grey shirt, beard, and it said damn on it. He didn't give me his name but if I get a picture I will update. Stay away especially if you're part of the lgbtq community."

So when the door is already left half open it takes away from the experience. I wish the staff here cared more about keeping the door shut when you're entering. Other than the decor this place is just a regular bar with expensive cocktails. It gets overly crowded and noisy and the \"speakeasy\" atmosphere gets lost in it.That being said it is a fun time and every time we have guests from out of town this place is in the back of mind to take them to."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

It is dark, cool, has great service, and  strong, slap yo mama in da butt cocktails.  Is it campy yes...check out the plastic skulls adorning the pillars. Are the drinks sugary, yes, but in Rome. Have I had better, yes, but not in Austin. At the recommendation of our \"reasoning for partying gal\" we gave this place a shot. We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds. I would highly recommend a one-and-done if you are ordering the Zombie."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

The entrance is at the bottom of a stairwell that starts up on the ground level.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and upon our arrival we were greeted by the staff, who were friendly and really knew their menu. The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks.

The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

The entrance is at the bottom of a stairwell that starts up on the ground level.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and upon our arrival we were greeted by the staff, who were friendly and really knew their menu. The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

Have I had better, yes, but not in Austin. At the recommendation of our \"reasoning for partying gal\" we gave this place a shot. We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds. I would highly recommend a one-and-done if you are ordering the Zombie."

My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds.

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks.

The entrance is at the bottom of a stairwell that starts up on the ground level.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and upon our arrival we were greeted by the staff, who were friendly and really knew their menu. The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

Have I had better, yes, but not in Austin. At the recommendation of our \"reasoning for partying gal\" we gave this place a shot. We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds. I would highly recommend a one-and-done if you are ordering the Zombie."

My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

          "content": "Having learned there was a new tiki bar in Austin I was very excited to check it out. My wife and our friends arrived at about 8:00 on a Thursday night. We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

Have I had better, yes, but not in Austin. At the recommendation of our \"reasoning for partying gal\" we gave this place a shot. We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds. I would highly recommend a one-and-done if you are ordering the Zombie."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong.

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable.

Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds.

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong.

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

The entrance is at the bottom of a stairwell that starts up on the ground level.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and upon our arrival we were greeted by the staff, who were friendly and really knew their menu. The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

The entrance is at the bottom of a stairwell that starts up on the ground level.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and upon our arrival we were greeted by the staff, who were friendly and really knew their menu. The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds.

This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks.

If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

          "content": "Trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber would be rolling over in their graves..... This is NOT a real tiki bar. Let me repeat that, this is NOT a real tiki bar. If you are a true tiki connoisseur this is not the place for you. This is a 6th street street bar. A funky, trendy 6th street bar. For a regular 6th street bar I'd give this a different rating but for advertising themselves as a tiki bar you get zero stars. Not even close. Nope. Nope. Nope.When I think of \"tiki\" I think of an \"experience\" and an atmosphere that is relaxing and soothing, if that's what you are looking for as well then you need to go elsewhere. Here you will be greeted by music so loud that our group couldn't talk talk to each other without screaming but we did get to enjoy the 6th street dance club loud level of music. No problem, I'm here for the drinks we can talk another time or I can text them. Although we were advised to get a reservation we just showed up and sat at a back table.Where do I begin with the drinks? I tried over four of them to make sure I didn't judge this place on one (possibly) incorrectly made drink. They were definitely consistent with all four drinks.They were all terrible.Polynesian Retreat: what in the actual f*** was this drink? Kool aid in a glass. Super sweet and sugary. The sweetness overwhelmed the drink. Mai Tai: I don't know why we ordered this one, it's so hard to make and everyone has their own version. It looked like a real mai tai but didn't taste like one. I only took one sip because I was ready to leave by this point. Nothing about it tasted tiki but maybe had they sold it was as a non tiki drink it could be salvaged.Fog Cutter: Sadness in a glass. One of the few drinks that didn't put me into sugar shock. Tasted completely off. Did they put vodka in this? Who knows. I was just happy I didn't go into a sugar coma. I got hints of lemon, orange, and vodka...? Wasn't very rum forward. Their take on it, I suppose. It did have gin in it as well. Washed Ashore: No comment. You get the point.I used to hate tiki drinks. Why? Because I only knew those tacky 80's versions where everything had that diabetic inducing sweetness with no depth in flavor. All that turned around a few years ago for me when I finally went to some real tiki bars - Three Dots and a Dash, Tiki Ti, Lost Lake, Latitude 29, False Idol, Tonga Hut, Mother of Pearl, etc - you get the point.  I appreciate real tiki bars and how they are all so different and specialize in their own \"thing\". With that being said, this is not a tiki place even though the drinks sound like tiki drinks. It made me sad that I drove all the way from San Antonio to check this bar out. I'd been looking forward to coming here and finding a real tiki bar close to me but, alas, it was not to be. I should have known better when I was saw dekuyper on their shelves but I wanted to give them a chance. The only fresh juice I saw was lemon and lime juice. Even the process of watching them make the drinks had me wincing - sometimes measuring and other times just free pouring gone wild. Awful tiki drinks. Awful flavors. I wanted to cry at how badly these cocktails were butchered. They are not worth the $12-14 price tag but perhaps for the happy hour prices it's doable (while closing your eyes and ignoring the \"tiki\" part of the drink and just enjoying them as sweet cocktails then it wouldn't be so bad). I also noticed that a lot of the tiki mugs looked eerily similar to Three Dots and a Dash. I mean if you're making that type of investment for a tiki bar please put more energy into making real tiki drinks. With that being said this place is better suited as a 6th street club-ish bar. They have a cute photo taking station on the wall that a lot of the young patrons enjoyed using. They definitely love Deep Eddy Vodka I saw it being poured in a lot of the drinks so maybe that's really their niche. Looks like I'll still be waiting for Austin to get a real tiki bar..."

          "content": "My husband and I were in town for one night after moving our son into college. This was near our hotel and we were excited because we've been to tiki bars in other cities and they were always so fun. As we were starting to walk down the stairs (it's underground) we were stopped and asked for our ID. I'll be 50 next month, so I should've been flattered, but I'm guessing everyone has to show their ID as it kind of had a club feel when we walked in. There was a DJ playing Sir Mix a Lot - Baby Got Back. I should've felt at home since that was from back in my day, but wasn't the tiki vibe we were hoping for. We were pleasantly surprised to find a couple seats on a Friday night at 9:30ish, sat down, and waited and waited. No one came to wait on us. Employees passed us a few times and no one acknowledged us. My husband was about to go up to the bar when a worker walked by again and asked if we were good (we must have looked confused or annoyed). We asked about ordering and he said you have to go up to the bar to order.  We both got a mai tai, which was ok, listened to some Fergie and Gwen Stefani playing, and were on our way. It wasn't bad, but definitely not like other tiki bars we've been to."

          "content": "Wanted to like this place. Finally a tiki bar in Austin! They have a great underground location, they have their own personalized tiki mugs and swizzle sticks, and the drinks are decent. Flavors were good, though they didn't seem as strong as other tiki drinks I've had. Also I know tiki drinks are complicated but service seemed really slow for how not busy they were on a Friday.Tables are all pretty small (only seat about 4) so if you have a bigger group you'll have to pull tables together or some will have to stand. Makes me feel really awkward to rearrange bar furniture. The atmosphere of this place is really lacking. It feels like they really went halfassed on the decor. Are they hoping to add more as they go? Very modern walls with no decorations, about six nautical type lights hung from the ceiling, and a grass skirt over the bar. You'll notice every picture on instagram is in front of their skull columns because that's the only thing vaguely tiki about it. So much more could be done with this space to make it a real tiki experience and it was pretty disappointing to walk into. Plus they had a DJ spinning loud top 40s hits - like you'd want in a 6th Street club, not adding to the tiki atmosphere at all. I would love to see a little more design put into the menus as well. Menu currently is just a list with no illustrations. I had to ask other groups for their menu both times I ordered because there didn't seem to be enough copies floating around the bar."

          "content": "Having learned there was a new tiki bar in Austin I was very excited to check it out. My wife and our friends arrived at about 8:00 on a Thursday night. We used the valet parking out front. But they told us they close at 10:00. Why would a valet outside of a bar close that early? But okay we'd figure that out later. The bar is quite large. It's mostly empty. The decor is mostly very modern. Not quite what I was expecting for a tiki bar. It was brightly lit for some reason. Polished floors. Very clean and modern. There is a thatch awning over the bar and two pillars is decorated with skulls. That was the extent of the tiki decor. We sit down at a table and quickly realize there is no table service. Not a big deal because it's not crowded. But if it were this would be a problem. So we go up and order a round. I tried the bar's signature drink the Washed Ashore. It was good but probably 85% ice. For the price I think that was a bit much. Next got a Zombie which was quite good. Finished off with a Hurricane which was just okay. I really want this bar to succeed. The drinks were pretty good but they need to double down on the tiki vibe. The modern look doesn't fit in my opinion. The staff were great. We talked to the manager for a bit and he was really nice.Definitely worth checking out."

It is dark, cool, has great service, and  strong, slap yo mama in da butt cocktails.  Is it campy yes...check out the plastic skulls adorning the pillars. Are the drinks sugary, yes, but in Rome. Have I had better, yes, but not in Austin. At the recommendation of our \"reasoning for partying gal\" we gave this place a shot. We all had their Zombie drink and yes the one drink per person limit is more than reasonable. The bartender was free pouring pretty heavy and I said here comes a tiki-style Long Island ice tea cocktail.Well, or drinks arrived in tall tiki glasses garnished with spearmint. Most likely used to cover up the alcohol fumes. I'm sure it was just a coincidence but as we slowly drained our cocktails our conversation became a tad more animated. I'm pretty sure I do not want our photo booth pics posted on the Web. To summarize a cool spot to have a highly/heavily spirited cocktail with your buds. I would highly recommend a one-and-done if you are ordering the Zombie."

The Lost Lei is located near the Capital Grille on 4th street with a few different entrances. Our party came off of 4th street and walked down the stairs to get inside. My friend, who joined us later, apparently came inside via another entrance. Inside is dimly lite and has skull decorations on the 2-3 pillars. We sat down at a table near the bar, and we grabbed a few drink menus. Everyone decided on the ZOMBIE drink. What is this drink you ask? This drink is about five shots of deliciousness and gets the job done. Not bad for $16. If you want something more mellow maybe try the Pain Killer?Overall a cool chill spot to grab a few drinks. They have a photo booth that allows you to take a few photos with friends, and you can email it to yourself to post on Instagram, Facebook, or twitter."

The entrance is at the bottom of a stairwell that starts up on the ground level.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and upon our arrival we were greeted by the staff, who were friendly and really knew their menu. The one thing that struck me potentially as a red flag was that the place was empty. However, this place had just recently opened when we went, so, I kept an open mind. We had two drinks there, and in that span of time, the place picked up a little, maybe 10-15 more people came for sunday-funday.Their drinks are very sweet, which I expected, and they weren't too strong. They were a little overpriced in my opinion.I think the place has potential, but it was not one of my highlights of my trip to Austin."
