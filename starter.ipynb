When we asked if one of us could go inside and let the people we were there to meet know that we could not stay, the door guy declined and advised us to just text them. My boyfriend then turned his hat backward, got in line, and was allowed inside. So apparently this guy was not the brightest but just on a power high.

This bartender made a drink with dark liquor instead of clear, when I requested clear, I took one sip and it was awful \\xa0imagine ice water with spiced rum \\xa0:( I ended up getting a beer, but this morning I see that the drink was still charged on my friends card. \\xa0 FIRST AND LAST EXPERIENCE with this bar!!!! watch out for the angry bartender who is hating her job and shouldn\\'t work with customers if she cant do her job properly.

I'm just choosing to not go back after my most recent experience.I walked up to the bar and handed the bartender my card to start a tab. The bartender told my girlfriend and I that they'd hold the card for open tabs, we agreed and got our drinks. About 30 minutes later, I walked up to get some more drinks. I told the bartender my last name, and half started to walk away. The bartender that had served us was not there any longer, and the 2 remaining bartenders said they didn't have my card or a tab with my name on it.They looked through all of the kept cards at the bar, and checked the computer for any charges under my name. After a couple minutes of looking, the bartender suggested that I was in the wrong bar...and I had used my card at a neighboring bar for drinks. At this point I'm a little bit irritated, but not a big deal...surely someone knows what's going on. They sent me to the outside bar, the outside bartender (who was not the man who took my card originally) said it was silly of them to send me out there.I went back to the inside bar to speak with the people there again. After pulling up my bank statement and proving that there was a charge on my card, the bartender explained how charges generally don't show up that quickly. That's fine and I'd believe that...IF I WEREN'T LOOKING AT MY BANK STATEMENT. I asked my girlfriend to collaborate my story at this point, because it seemed like the staff didn't believe me. After about 15 minutes of standing at the bar, the bartender slammed a card holder down with my card in it. He explained to me closed out tabs have their cards left in a holder.I calmly explained to the staff that I had agreed to keep the tab open, and did not walk my tab. The bartender ended up giving us a few drinks on the house for our trouble, that is the only thing saving this review from a 1 star rating.I will not go back here again, there are PLENTY of other bars on east 6th street.TL;DR - I went to get a 2nd round of drinks for friends on an open tab, spent 30 minutes trying to find my credit card that the staff had lost.\"},\n",

The bathroom sitch is a REAL issue, especially during peak hours (there is only one, and to alleviate the problem they're installed porta-potties in the back -- gross).

Hey... a bunch of mid-30 somethings with kids that used to party hard back in the day get a girls night out... shooooooooot..... LOL Apparently the IN thing is to have a lot of facial hair, MEN.. so this is totally your kind of place ladies!! Did I mention how friendly our bartenders was? We have the cutie with the long and pointed stache', and the bigger guy with the reddish beard. Both made good drink suggestions, and were cool then a fan.. so they made it pleasant despite the mix of the crowd and heavier music.\"},\n",

The patio leads into an even larger outdoor area that has an outside bar (typically open on weekends), a few outhouses (with a public sink you will use out of shame), the occasional puppy (dogs allowed), and a delicious food trailer (which shines like a beacon of steamed bun salvation). The trailer is one of many East Side King pop ups and will definitely influence your visit. This food is from the mind of Paul Qui, a local celebrity around here. He won top chef Texas and owns one of the most prolific sushi joints in town and in his spare time he loves feeding the inebriated. What a guy!Final thought, this place is a madhouse on the weekends.

       "   'content': \"I hear your cries of 'hipster.' There is a certain crowd in attendance on busy nights. But there's no denying that, aside from the crowd, Shangri La is pretty much an east 6th landmark going into it's second year.Move past the standard Friday and Saturday night crowd. It's the same crews you'll find at Beauty Bar. Shangri should be evaluated based on prices, service, music, drink availability, etc., like any other bar. Let's take the crowd out of the picture, because - let's be honest - most bars in this area are plagued with the same problem.In the aforementioned areas of evaluation, Shangri La is a winner. Liquor prices, especially during the day, are hard and potentially illegal to beat. They aren't known for their cocktails - they're known for mixed drinks. Yes, the slurry - and by slurry I don't mean a suspension of solids in liquid but rather how it makes you speak - concoction of soda pop and hard liquor that is most commonly served at crappy 6th Street bars. (I don't care how much of a cocktail snob you are - a well-mixed gin and tonic or a rum and coke is nothing at which to turn your nose up. If you really want an old-fashioned or a sidecar, go next door to the Showroom.)Services is alright and improves, like at any bar, as the bartenders recognize you. They've got one of the best jukeboxes in town. They've got a wide selection of liquors and a solid beer selection as well, including Brooklyn Lager on draft. Strangely, the back bar (open only on busy, hipster-filled nights) has more beer on draft than the front bar does.Factor in two somewhat-well-maintained pool tables, a smattering of old school video game cabinets, and the rarely used back stage, and you've got yourself one of the best bars on sixth street.Note: you've got to be understanding about the door guys. This place gets lots of traffic on the weekends, which means they've had at least one or two visits from the TABC. Those dudes are devious. They will use expired IDs, boldfaced lies and a variety of other tactics to get in and hit a bar with a hefty fine.\"},\n",

Our friend proceeded to take out a student ID so that the bartender could verify that the picture and name matched, but the bartender wouldn\\'t budge.Our friend walked over to our table and sat down to inform us of what was going on. Seconds later the bartender came over and told our friend that he could no longer be inside the bar.Our friend with the temporary ID left the bar with our friend that rode with him in tow (even though she had just purchased a beer). When the last member of out group arrived minutes later, she came straight to our table and was able to drink the left beer without being carded (since she never approached the bar). The rest of the group finished their beers and went to another trivia night where they would accept the temporary ID.I completely understand the right to refuse service to anyone, but this was such an odd situation. The temporary ID was a government issued form of ID that included a picture and the bartender refused to even look at it to verify its authenticity. He even snapped that he \"didn\\'t want to talk about it\" at one of my other friends who came to talk to him and our friend with the temporary ID.It\\'s also hypocritical that my other friend was able to enter the bar and drink a full pre-bought beer without being carded just after this whole situation occurred.

The clowns...not so much. there was frustration and not some great things being said and some of them were caught trying to bring their own personal alcohol into the bar which is outrageous. i started getting uncomfortable because this was a rowdy group with a strong sense of entitlement who were not being friendly to the people trying to let them have a good night. the thing that really got to me was when i was standing inside the crowded bar and one of the clowns blew an air-horn for an extended amount of time after i remember the person at the door nicely telling them not to blow the air-horn at all that night once they entered the bar. the staff responded quickly and effectively and still in the friendly shangri-la manner. thankfully the clowns left and i regained hearing in my ear after the air-horn incident. anyways, i love this bar...you will too!p.s. of course people were saying that they don\\'t like clowns. haven\\'t you seen \"IT\" or \"Killer Klowns from outer space\"?!'},\n",

I love the people, the vibe you get when you walk in and the drink prices aren\\'t bad either. Hipster Central! I love it. Get a PBR and you are good to go. Another friend of mine and I met an eccentric girl in a leather jacket. I introduced myself \"I love your jacket!\" and we began chatting about fashion and how I needed a leather jacket myself. Her quirky bangs and fab jacket embody this place. The patio is another great aspect of Shangri-La. If you need a break from the music inside you can head out to the patio chairs outside and people watch. There is always a myriad of cute guys to look at both outside and inside so my friends and I always enjoy looking at the hipster eye candy.'},\n",

It is obviously working - there are more hipsters here than in your flagship American Apparel store. \\xa0Honestly, the Salvation Army should set up an outlet store across the street just to keep everyone here dressed. \\xa0Despite this, the vibe is cool and comfortable and no one really seems to care whether you're a hipster or not. \\xa0Although you might feel out of place if you're over 30, no one in the very young crowd really seems to care about that either. \\xa0It's as if this place really is Shangri-La, everyone just peacefully co-existing! \\xa0 If only the rest of the world could be this happy all the time. \\xa0The drinks are strong and reasonably priced and for those of you who prefer a classic beer, they have lone star (among others) available as well. Inside is the smallish dive bar that is really trying to exist in the 60s or 70s - not my favorite place to be. Out on the back patio is an entirely different world. The crowd remains the same, but the patio, really more of a backyard, is a great place to spend a sunny day or pleasant evening. They have a bar back here (open on busy nights and weekends) and a couple port-o-cans, so you barely even have to move from your seat. Dog friendly as well. We stopped by here on Wednesday afternoon of SXSW and had a blast. FREE, yes, absolutely FREE Brooklyn Lager was flowing all afternoon and there were some really good bands playing as well (and a couple lousy ones). It was funny to see that they let in some actual bums as well - they were really enjoying the free beer. :) \\xa0 Nice to see them catch a break once in a while. \\xa0 They are quite photogenic as well - I got some real gems.Franklin BBQ was there too, although it wasn't as good as at the trailer.

Honestly, it was just nice to have that kind of mix in one place and have no problems.

The biggest flaw Shangri-La has is that its to close to Dirty 6th and its gotten to big from reviews so a lot of the wrong crowd has shown up. We went on saturday which I usually stay away from bars on saturday because I don't like crowded bars because I don't like to wait for a drink. When we went right away I knew we would have a problem because their was a group of guys in their wearing their frat shirts. I made a little comment about it and the others who are regulars chuckled and gave the yup look. Well my friend who is a girl got into a bit of an argument that ended up with him pushing a chair into her and calling her fat. The owner was good about hearing about this and going in right away to find out what happened. Unfortunately he kept the guy in the bar and just told him to stay away which we all know drunk + douche bag = wants to fight. He came back later and started picking a fight. We closed out and left but as we left I have to say Tyler the owner and Emily his wife were AMAZING! The ran up to us and apologized greatly about it. He explained why he let the guy stay (I didn't really agree with it but its his bar) and he apologized for they way she was treated. We told them both about how he came back and Tyler zoomed right in their to get him out. Then to make it even more awesome when I saw them monday at another bar they recognized me. I feel bad for them because its such an awesome bar and they are trying to create an environment for the rest of us actual Austinites who don't get drunk and fight people but its starting to become over run. But the staff, drink prices and the rest of the people are what keeps me coming back. I will say the two reasons I did not give 5 stars is the over run of douche bags coming in and the fact I can't bring my dog inside like I can at Liberty.\"},\n",

We just drove back into town from a road trip. The ride late at night and the heat had us irritated. We needed to drop our internal temperature and cool parched throats so we darted down 6th to Shangri-La on our trek back home. We shouldn\\'t have. We were in foul moods made worse by the festive packed atmosphere at Shangri-La. As we went inside the air conditioner spit condensation all over my head. What the F@#$! And it smelled like a cross between perm solution and kitty litter. Things were not looking so good. I\\'m waiting in line to go to the bathroom and the guy behind me, who must have been having a good time says, \"kick it open.\" I said it was occupied and the guy who walked in there told me he was on Xanax. I think, \"Like I\\'m going to kick the door open, just cos you tell me to!\" Then I think, \"Shouldn\\'t this guy behind me be at someplace like J-Blacks, or better yet, the Ranch?\" Besides, Mr. Xanax\\'s altered state, whether he needed the medication or not, would suffer from such an invasion. I tell this to Mr. J-Black\\'s. He says, \"Kick it open anyway.\" I don\\'t. But I\\'m not liking it here. This is not the scene I expected. But in retrospect I don\\'t fault any of this for my initial dislike. I blame my foul-assed mood. With the exception of Mr. J-Black\\'s, this bar, the people that go there, and the milieu in general are what I prefer in a watering hole. I have been back several times since, during which I had good times. The juke box is very good. The drinks are good to very good, but better than that they are well priced. The staff are all cool kids and keep things humming along. Nathan is a very good host during happy hour.

Don\\'t leave anything visible in your cars parked streetside because more \"outsiders\" are starting to park in the area in order to walk to the other side of I-35 to 6th street and don\\'t say I didn\\'t tell ya so. Also, wear flip-flops at your own risk because they have cool crushed glass at the entryway.If you see a silver scooter outside, it\\'s me. Say Hi and Yelp away!!'},\n",

In the novel Lost Horizon, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living years beyond the normal lifespan. The word also evokes the imagery of exoticism of the Orient. The story of Shangri-La is based on the concept of Shambhala, a mystical city in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.In China, Tao Qian of the Jin Dynasty described a Shangri-La in his work Story of the Peach Blossom Valley (Chinese: pinyin: Táohu Yuán Jì). In modern China, the Zhongdian country was renamed to \\xa0(Xinggéll, Shanri-La in Chinese) in 2001, to attract tourists. The legendary Kun Lun Mountains in Tibet offer other possible Shangri-La valleys.A popularly believed inspiration for Shangri-La is the Hunza Valley in northern Pakistan, close to the Tibetan border, which Hilton visited a few years before Lost Horizon was published. Being an isolated green valley surrounded by mountains, enclosed on the western end of the Himalayas, it closely matches the description in the novel. A Shangri-La resort in the nearby Skardu valley is a popular tourist attraction.Today, various places claim the title, such as parts of southern Kham in southwestern Yunnan province, including the tourist destinations of Lijiang and Zhongdian. Places like Sichuan and Tibet also claim the real Shangri-La was in its territory. In 2001, Tibet Autonomous Region put forward a proposal that the three regions optimise all Shangri-la tourism resources and promote them as one. After failed attempts to establish a China Shangri-la Ecological Tourism Zone in 2002 and 2003, government representatives of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region signed a declaration of cooperation in 2004. Also in 2001, Zhongdian County in northwestern Yunnan officially renamed itself Shangri-La County.Shangri-la is often used in a similar context to which \"Garden of Eden\" might be used, to represent a perfect paradise that exists hidden from modern man. It can sometimes be used as an analogy for a life-long quest or something elusive that is much sought. For a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man\\'s \"Shangri-La\". It also might be used to represent perfection that is sought by man in the form of love, happiness, or Utopian ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of somewhat similar metaphors such as The Holy Grail, El Dorado, The Fountain of Youth, and to an extent \"white whale\" (referring to the white whale chased by the obsessed Captain Ahab in the book Moby-Dick).\"Yeah. Shangri-La is a bar, dude, on the east side. It is quite cool - they have a huge outdoor patio thing, the entryway of which is lined with something those of us who have been are pretty sure is glittering mashed glass gravel. On the inside, they\\'ve got about 6 or 7 arcade machines right smack from the early 80\\'s, all neary functional, still only a quarter [BLUE VALKYRIE IS ABOUT TO DIE!] 2 pool tables and many cues (hey, we all know the usual cue at a bar is gonna suck, but at least you can pick the least shitty one instead of one that is for somebody 3 feet tall).They have a functional jukebox with a bevy of soundtrax and the 3 tunes for a buck. I was there NYE, the drinks were strong, and they had the \\'2nd Sunday Sock Hop\\' going on with all night DJ, a $10 cover & free entry before 9.At least one ambulance showed up for a passed out girl, and as I\\'ve mentioned before, though I don\\'t agree, Ice-T & Body Count once told me that unless 2 ambulances show up during a show, it\\'s no good. Although Shangri-La mentioned \\'bar food\\' for $1, which is nice of them (and we\\'re still uncertain what the \\'bar food\\' was) really the only thing keeping this place from being a 5 star for me is a grill a-la-Casino el Camino.So: we twisted and boogied until we could boogie no more, and the man in the fedora and tie tapped me on the shoulder and shook my hand on the way out, and said \"Thank you for coming.\"Beat that, craptastic west-side 6th street bar.'},\n",

There was an intriguing assortment of gun paintings on plywood hanging on the wall, which may have held my attention just long enough to allow the vibe to be redeemed by the plethora of old-school arcade style video games in the back corner. If there\\'s one thing I love, it\\'s a little Mortal Kombat with my cocktails. They also get points for super-sweet bartenders, a special \"Shangri-La Blend\" hand soap in the ladies room, and for playing the music loud enough to hear, but not so loud that I couldn\\'t carry on complete conversations with the people I was there with.Oh, and they played Tupac - whether intended as ironic or just damn good music that earns some points in my book.'},\n",

I walk by this place every morning on my way to work, so I was intrigued to see the teal paint go up. Honestly, I wouldn\\'t shut up about it for the couple of weeks before it opened, and I was there within the first three days.Its expansive interior was thankfully uncrowded, although we got there early. Two bar-sized pool tables and what may be best-described as \\'nouveau retro\\' interior makes you feel kind of like you\\'re hanging out in your grandparents\\' basement, if your grandparents are the type to have a great jukebox and pictures of guns on the wall (it\\'s classier than it sounds). Beer prices are comparable to anywhere else in this neighborhood, which is to say, perfectly reasonable.The biggest selling point, most likely, is the enormous back yard - not terribly amenable to winter weather, but bigger than Rio Rita\\'s (by far) and replete with picnic tables. Plus there were guys out there telling me they\\'d watch my bike for me because the bike racks hadn\\'t arrived yet. Back in Brooklyn I would have walked out at that, but these guys actually meant it.In a nutshell: If you must walk west down 6th St., this is as far as you need go.
